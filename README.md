# LeetCode Exercises Repository

This repository is focused on solving LeetCode problems, ranging from easy to difficult, to train programming techniques and logic skills. I am working on these exercises in Python, allowing me to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
As with LeetCode, where we only code the logic of the function, the code in this repository also focuses solely on the function logic. The implementations are tailored to make sense depending on the specific problem statement and requirements.
